-- 001 — the conversation log
--
-- What a patron asked a library, and what MARC.IA answered. Durable, so a
-- conversation survives a restart and so the benchmarking study in
-- docs/ideias_artigos_academicos.md has transcripts rather than screenshots.
--
-- WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT HOLD
--
-- Nothing that identifies a person. No name, no email, no phone number, no IP,
-- no platform identifier. The root README's non-goal — "LibVox does not store
-- patron identity; conversations are scoped to a session, not to a person" —
-- survives persistence only if the schema makes it survive, and the absence of
-- those columns is the enforcement.
--
-- That matters more now than it did when history died with the process. Before,
-- what someone asked a library vanished; now it is durable, so a leak exposes
-- it. Which is also why retention is a command and not a suggestion: see
-- migration 002 and `libvox-core prune`.
--
-- No BEGIN/COMMIT here: the migration runner wraps each file in its own
-- transaction, and a COMMIT inside would close it out from under the runner.

-- A conversation is library data like any other, and rule 4 applies unchanged:
-- the database enforces the scoping, not the author of each query. A forgotten
-- WHERE returns nothing rather than another library's conversations.
--
-- `messages` has no tenant_id of its own on purpose -- it would be a second
-- copy of a fact, and the two could disagree. It is reached through its
-- conversation, whose policy the subquery re-evaluates under the same scope.
